## About ##
There are two primary tasks for any recognition system, detection (finding the location and size of the object on the input image), and classification (classifying the detected objects into subclasses). Both tasks are usually done with a single detection/classification model such as YOLO or SSD, where input images are labelled with the bounding boxes and respective classes. However, labelling and training such datasets requires a lot of time and effort. Therefore the main goal of this project is to detect just one main class (signs), and integrate a custom built Convolutional Neural Network to classify detected objects (subclasses such as speed limit, stop signs etc). This way, we just need to train a detection model once, to detect one main class, while multiple classification models can be trained to classify detected objects as per task requirements.
